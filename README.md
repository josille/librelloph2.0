Lite OJS with Boostrap
==============

Extension of the original OJS, all javascript and css were removed, leaving the layout strictly with boostrap framework for layout.
This project was separated from OJS to only display journal information and articles, the OJS cms and submission system works independently in a different project.

And still some work to do...
