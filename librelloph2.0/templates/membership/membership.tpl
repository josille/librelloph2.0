	<p><strong>Librello Membership</strong></p>
	<p>Librello was founded to democratize scientific knowledge. Our electronic journals offer unrestricted, unlimited, free access to any reader, with no subscription or registration required. Our members support the project through the payment of annual membership fees, allowing them to submit an unlimited number of manuscripts for consideration. All manuscripts undergo a meticulous and stringent single-blind peer review process, and only manuscripts deemed of sufficient quality and relevance will be accepted for publication. Our work goes beyond the organization of a fast, yet rigorous single-blind peer review and the archive of publications. For each journal we aim to publish the most relevant research and to guarantee the highest visibility of all articles by including our contents in the most important indexing and abstracting databases.</p>
	<p><strong>Librello Individual Membership</strong></p>
	<p>Membership is valid for one year and allows an author to submit manuscripts to all Librello&rsquo;s journals without any further costs or article processing charges. The membership fee is set at CHF 156 (about 161 US Dollars).</p>
	<p>To become a member of Librello, an author simply registers with one of the journals. Membership fees can be paid via PayPal within 48 hours of registration. If an article has multiple authors, at least five of the authors, including the corresponding author, must be members of Librello.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Librello Institutional Membership</strong></p>
	<p>Institutions interested in supporting open access and increasing the proportion of their publications available to the broad public are welcome to join Librello&rsquo;s institutional membership. The institutional membership benefits all affiliated researchers with the possibility of unlimited submission, and can be pursuit by an annual flat fee based on the number of academic and research staff of the institution.</p>
	<p>For a membership quote please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:membership@librelloph.com" _mce_href="mailto:membership@librelloph.com">membership@librelloph.com</a>.</p>
