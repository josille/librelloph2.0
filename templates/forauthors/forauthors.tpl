	<p>
The progress of science is only possible by the exchange of ideas and the discussion of theories and paradigms. Our mission is to provide a new environment for the publication of scientific articles with free and unlimited access to readers. Our fast, yet rigorous peer review process aims at selecting and improving high quality scientific manuscripts toward publication.
Our open access policy benefits all parties. Authors and their institutions profit from the high visibility of their work, whereas the society benefits from the availability of the knowledge produced with public funds. Our charges support all the work involving the coordination of the peer-review process, the online storage of the DOI-numbered articles and the indexing and abstracting in external data bases.

	<p><b>Peer Review (Review Policy)</b></p>
	<p>
	Our journals have a fast yet rigorous peer-review process. After an in-house pre-screening of the manuscript, we carefully select experts in the topic to review and evaluate the submission. We collect at least two reviews from high qualified scholars before sending it for decision to the Editor-in-Chief or one of the Editorial Board members. The usual deadline for a reviewer to submit the report is two weeks. The manuscripts are evaluated according to the originality, scientific or technical content, quality of the presentation and interest to the readers.
